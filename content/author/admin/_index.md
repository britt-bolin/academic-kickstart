I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [Graduate School of Economic and Social Sciences](https://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) and a research associate and lecturer at the [Chair of Political Economy](http://polecon.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/) at the University of Mannheim. 

I specialize in comparative politics, political economy, and public policy analysis, with a substantive focus on women in politics, gender economics, and leadership and representation. I use empirical quantitative and computational methods, with a particular interest in causal inference. My dissertation project analyzes gender quotas and womenâ€™s access to political leadership positions.

My research has been supported by the [Foundation of German Business (SDW)](https://www.sdw.org/), the [German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)](https://www.daad.de/de/), and the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/), among others.

Prior to graduate school, I spent several years working in diplomacy, public policy, government, and strategy consulting in both Germany and the United States.
